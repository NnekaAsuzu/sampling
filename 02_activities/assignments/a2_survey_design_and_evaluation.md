# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
For the Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (Cycle 33):

1. Sample Type:

This is a sample survey with a cross-sectional design. The survey uses a stratified probability sampling approach at the province and Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) level. Information is collected from one randomly selected household member aged 15 or older, and proxy responses are not permitted.

Due to the difficulty in reaching volunteers, rejective sampling was also applied: after respondents were classified as volunteers or not, all volunteers completed a long interview, while non-volunteers were randomly divided into two groups — one completed a long interview, and the other completed a short interview.


2. Sample Size:

A field sample of approximately 50,000 units was used. About 40,000 invitation letters to the electronic questionnaire were sent to households, with an expected completion of 24,000 questionnaires.

3. Target Population:

All persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada, excluding full-time residents of institutions (those residing for more than six months).

4. Sampling Frame:

The sampling frame combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada’s dwelling frame. Records on the frame are groups of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address (or a single telephone number if the link to an address could not be established). This design was used to obtain better coverage of households with a telephone number.

5. Survey Modes:

Data were collected directly from respondents using two modes:

Electronic questionnaire (self-administered online)

Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI)

Respondents could choose to complete the survey in English or French, and proxy reporting was not permitted.

6. Timeline:

-- Reference period: 12 months preceding the interview date

-- Collection period: September 4 – December 28, 2018

-- Frequency: Every 5 years

7. Response Rate:

The overall response rate was 41.9%.

8. Weights:

-- A person-level weighting factor (WGHT_PER) was applied to ensure the data represented the Canadian population aged 15 and older.
-- Additional bootstrap weights were created for design-based variance estimation.
-- Weights were adjusted to align the weighted income distribution with the 2017 Canadian Income Survey (CIS) by province.

9. Data Processing:

Data processing was conducted using Statistics Canada’s SSPE generalized processing system to ensure high-quality, harmonized outputs.
Automatic and manual edits were performed at both micro and macro levels to verify consistency, family relationships, and questionnaire flow.
The CATI system performed in-interview validity checks and edits.

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc

Imputation was used to address item or partial non-response. Except in a few cases, missing values were filled using donor records selected through a score function: characteristics of the recipient record were compared with donor records, and the donor with the highest score was used to fill in missing information. If multiple donors had the same score, one was randomly selected. Where donor imputation was not feasible, mean imputation from a pool of donors was used.

Imputation was carried out in nine steps:

Personal income and family income
2–4. Formal volunteering variables in the master file
5–6. Informal volunteering variables in the master file
7–9. Donation file variables and solicitation methods in the master file

For 2018, personal income questions were not asked directly. Income information was obtained by linking respondents’ survey data to the 2017 T1 Family File (T1FF). Family income was obtained for 81.7% of households from direct linkage, and missing information for the remainder was imputed.

The GSS imputation process ensured incomplete responses were filled with data from similar respondents, increasing the number of usable survey units for analysis.

11. Sources of Error:

The survey is subject to both sampling and non-sampling errors.

Sampling error: Variation that arises because results are based on a sample rather than a census. Bootstrap weights were used to estimate sampling variability.

Non-sampling error: Includes coverage errors, non-response bias, response errors, and processing errors.

Coverage error: Although the frame improved over past methods, some under- or over-coverage may remain.

Non-response bias: Adjusted for through weighting using auxiliary data such as income and household composition.

Response/processing errors: Minimized through interviewer training, questionnaire testing, and automated quality controls.

12. Limitations, known biases, etc:

The survey results are subject to non-sampling errors, including coverage errors, non-response, response errors, and processing errors.

Coverage errors may occur because some parts of the target population were excluded or underrepresented, such as households not included in the sampling frame.

Non-response bias may remain even after weighting adjustments. For the 2018 GSS, adjustments were made using auxiliary data such as income and household composition to account for non-responding households.

The survey excludes residents of the territories and institutional populations, which limits national generalizability.
